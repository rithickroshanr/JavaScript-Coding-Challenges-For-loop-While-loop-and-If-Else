JavaScript Coding Challenges: Control Flow Mastery (for, while, if-else)

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of JavaScript coding challenges focused on mastering fundamental control flow statements.  The exercises are designed to build a strong foundation in logic and iteration, suitable for learners at all levels.

The questions are structured into three main categories:

    for Loop Questions 

    while Loop Questions 
    
    if-else Statement Questions 

Each category is further divided by difficulty, allowing for progressive learning and practice:

Simple (Beginner) 

Medium (Intermediate) 

Hard (Advanced) 

Topics Covered Include:

    Basic Iteration: Printing number sequences , counting down , and repeating actions.

    Array Manipulation: Iterating through elements , finding the largest number , removing duplicates , and searching.
    
    String Manipulation: Reversing strings , counting character occurrences , and checking for palindromes.
    
    Mathematical Problems: Calculating sums , factorials , prime numbers , and the Fibonacci sequence.
    
    Algorithms: Implementing Bubble Sort , binary search , and the Euclidean algorithm.
    
    Pattern Printing: Creating grids of asterisks and Floyd's Triangle.

    Conditional Logic: Checking conditions like age for voting , leap years , and implementing user login logic.
